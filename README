Example of recording load averages to Monitis using shell scripts os OS X

These are based on the original bash example scripts, but modified 
to focus on recording the load averages, and for the different xpath
syntax in the default OS X installation of xpath.

monitis_create_load_monitor.sh

Creates the external monitor used to record the load averages. Don't forget to
set the API key and secret in the script, or export the values in your shell.

    $ export APIKEY="your API key"
    $ export SECRETKEY="your API secret"


monitis_record_load.sh

Gets the load averages from the uptime command, and records them to the
specified Monitis external monitor. The API key and secret are specified as
command line arguments.

Examples

    # create the monitor
    $ ./monitis_create_load_monitor.sh
    {"status":"ok","data":797}

    # record the current load averages
    $ ./monitis_record_load.sh -a <api_key> -s <api_secret> -i 797
    {"status":"ok","data":null}
